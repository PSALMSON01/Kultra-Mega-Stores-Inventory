**11** If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer**

No, the company did not appropriately spend shipping costs based on Order Priority.

Delivery Truck = slowest, cheapest
Express Air = fastest, most expensive

To be efficient:
Critical orders should ideally use Express Air
Low priority orders should use Delivery Truck
Regular Air can be for Medium/High priorities as a compromise

There are many Critical priority orders sent by the slowest method 
There is a mismatch indicates poor alignment between urgency and speed.

There is no strong alignment between Order Priority and the Shipping Method used. High-cost, fast shipping (Express Air) is used for non-critical orders, and slow shipping is used for critical ones. This suggests:

Inefficient use of shipping budgets

Potential risk to customer satisfaction for delayed critical orders

Missed opportunity to save on low-priority shipments
